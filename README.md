üîó Live Demo: https://your-username.github.io/budget-tracker/

This app allows users to set a monthly budget, add expense items with descriptions and amounts, and track their total spending. It dynamically calculates the total spent and the remaining balance, giving users an instant overview of their financial activity. The interface is clean, mobile-friendly, and easy to use.

Built with core web technologies ‚Äî HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality ‚Äî this project demonstrates how powerful even a simple front-end project can be for learning and practical use. No frameworks or libraries are used, making it a great beginner-friendly project to understand the basics of DOM manipulation, event handling, and data tracking.

To use this app:
1. Enter your monthly budget.
2. Add your expenses one by one using the description and amount fields.
3. The app will display all expenses, show the total spent, and update the remaining balance live.

To run locally:
- Clone the repository from GitHub: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/budget-tracker.git`
- Open the `index.html` file in your browser. That‚Äôs it ‚Äî no installation required.

This project is deployed using GitHub Pages and can be accessed live at the link above. Future improvements planned include LocalStorage support to save expenses between sessions, expense categories, editing and deleting individual items, and eventually converting the project to use a framework like React.
